                    With over ten years of professional experience in software development, 
                    I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of languages in a 
                    diverse set of companies. My background does includes full stack 
                    development, but a majority of the experience was focused specifically 
                    on backend development. I'm particularly good at being dropped into 
                    a code base, picking up the context, and contributing as quickly 
                    as possible, but I'm capable of leading teams and mentoring new 
                    developers as well. I have a passion for life long learning and 
                    am always challenging myself professionally and personally by 
                    taking on projects outside of my comfort zone.
